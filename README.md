🚀 II. Technical Pinnacle: WebRTC Integration for Calls

The core technical achievement in Nebula Chat is the implementation of WebRTC for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) voice and video calls.

P2P Calls: Media streams are transmitted directly between users without passing through a central server, ensuring ultra-low latency and enhanced privacy.

Signaling Mechanism: Firebase Firestore is utilized as the signaling intermediary to exchange metadata (SDP Offers/Answers and ICE Candidates), coordinating the connection without carrying the actual call data load.

Implementation: The complex WebRTC lifecycle management is fully encapsulated within a dedicated call_service.dart file, resulting in clean and maintainable code.

🛠️ III. Architectural Excellence (Clean Architecture)

The codebase is structured to be highly scalable and maintainable, reflecting a deep understanding of software design patterns (SOLID Principles).

A. Organized Code Structure

The file hierarchy demonstrates a clear Separation of Concerns, strictly adhering to Clean Architecture:

model/: Pure data models.

screens/: User Interface and Presentation layer.

services/: All business logic and external APIs. This is the core engine, containing critical services like auth_service, chat_service, and the key call_service (WebRTC).

B. Highlighting Advanced Call Features

A dedicated UI mockup emphasizes the video call feature to reinforce the application's advanced functionalities:
